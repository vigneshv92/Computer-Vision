# Computer Vision Course Overview
This course is broken into three main sections:

## 1. [Introduction to Computer Vision](Notes/Intro_to_Computer_Vision.md)</br>

 * [Computer Vision Pipeline](Notes/CV_Pipeline.md)
 * [Image Representation & Classification](Notes/Image_Representation_And_Classification.md)</br>
 * [Facial Keypoint Detection]()
 * [Notebooks](https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Exercises)
 
This lesson covers topics like image processing, feature extraction done manually or through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch.

## 2. Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning </br>

 * [Computer Vision and Deep Learning](Notes/Advanced_Computer_Vision_and_Deep_Learning.md)</br>
 * [Deep Learning Algorithms](Notes/Advanced_Computer_Vision_And_Deep_Learning_Algorithms.md)
 * [Image Captioning]()

This lesson is all about advances in deep learning architectures like region-based CNN's, YOLO and single-shot detection algorithms, and CNN's used in combination with recurrent neural networks.

## 3. Object Tracking and Localization </br>
  * [Introduction to Motion](Notes/Introduction_to_Motion.md)
  * [Object Tracking](Notes/Object_Tracking.md)
  * [Localization](https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Localization_Exercises)
  
This lesson covers how a robot can move and sense the world around it, creating a visual representation of the world as it navigates.

Each of these three sections will have an associated project that allows you to demonstrate the skills you've learned in each part.

# Projects

Youâ€™ll learn computer vision and deep learning techniques by getting to apply your skills to a variety of projects.
The three project in this course are as follows:

* Facial Keypoint Detection
* Automatic Image Captioning
* Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

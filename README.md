# Computer Vision Course Overview
This course is broken into three main sections:

* Intro to Computer Vision, which covers topics like image processing, feature extraction done manually or through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch.

* Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning, which is all about advances in deep learning architectures like region-based CNN's, YOLO and single-shot detection algorithms, and CNN's used in combination with recurrent neural networks.

* Object Tracking and Localization, which covers how a robot can move and sense the world around it, creating a visual representation of the world as it navigates.

Each of these three sections will have an associated project that allows you to demonstrate the skills you've learned in each part.

# Projects

You’ll learn computer vision and deep learning techniques by getting to apply your skills to a variety of projects.
The three project in this course are as follows:

* Facial Keypoint Detection
* Automatic Image Captioning
* Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

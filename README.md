# Computer Vision Course Overview
This course is broken into three main sections:

* [Introduction to Computer Vision](Notes/Intro_to_Computer_Vision.md)</br>
 This lesson covers topics like image processing, feature extraction done manually or through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch.

* [Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning]()</br>
This lesson is all about advances in deep learning architectures like region-based CNN's, YOLO and single-shot detection algorithms, and CNN's used in combination with recurrent neural networks.

* Object Tracking and Localization, which covers how a robot can move and sense the world around it, creating a visual representation of the world as it navigates.

Each of these three sections will have an associated project that allows you to demonstrate the skills you've learned in each part.

Youâ€™ll learn computer vision and deep learning techniques by getting to apply your skills to a variety of projects.
The three project in this course are as follows:

* Facial Keypoint Detection
* Automatic Image Captioning
* Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

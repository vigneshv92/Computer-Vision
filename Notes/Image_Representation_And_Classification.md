## Computer Vision Pipeline

A computer vision pipeline is a series of steps that most computer vision applications will go through. Many vision applications start off by acquiring images and data, then processing that data, performing some analysis and recognition steps, then finally performing an action. The general pipeline is pictured below!

Now, let's take a look at a specific example of a pipeline applied to facial expression recognition.

## Standardizing Data

Pre-processing images is all about standardizing input images so that you can move further along the pipeline and analyze images in the same way. In machine learning tasks, the pre-processing step is often one of the most important.

For example, imagine that you've created a simple algorithm to distinguish between stop signs and other traffic lights.

### Images as Numerical Data

Every pixel in an image is just a numerical value and, we can also change these pixel values. We can multiply every single one by a scalar to change how bright the image is, we can shift each pixel value to the right, and many more operations!

Treating images as grids of numbers is the basis for many image processing techniques.

Most color and shape transformations are done just by mathematically operating on an image and changing it pixel-by-pixel.

### Importance of Color

In general, when you think of a classification challenge, like identifying lane lines or cars or people, you can decide whether color information and color images are useful by thinking about your own vision.

If the identification problem is easier in color for us humans, itâ€™s likely easier for an algorithm to see color images too!
